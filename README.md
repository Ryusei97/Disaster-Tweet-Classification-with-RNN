# Disaster-Tweet-Classification-with-RNN

This repository contains a notebook for disaster tweet classification using RNNs. The dataset is from Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). Natural language processing is a field that helps computers understand human language. Disaster tweet classification is a binary classification task where the machine learning model will need to predict whether a tweet is about a disaster or not. There are many subtleties to natural language that will be hard for a model to pick up. Human language is not always literal so the model will need to be able to distinguish between literal and figurative speech effectively to be successful. 

A Recurrent Neural Network is used for the model in this project. RNNs are have a recurrent path that feeds back to itself which helps dealing with sequential data.
